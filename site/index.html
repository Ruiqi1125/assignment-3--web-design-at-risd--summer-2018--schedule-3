<p class="intro">
   H.C. Dieter Rams (born 20 May 1932 in Wiesbaden, Hessen) is a German industrial designer and retired academic closely associated with the consumer products company Braun and the functionalist school of industrial design. His unobtrusive approach and belief in "less but better" design generated a timeless quality in his products and have influenced the design of many products, which also secured Rams worldwide recognition and appreciation.
